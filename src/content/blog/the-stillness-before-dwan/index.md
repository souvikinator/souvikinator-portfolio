Late nights and the moments before dawn have always amazed me. There's something mystical and soothing about that time. It's just you, enjoying your own company and doing things you love without any expectations. No distractions, just stillness.

Since high school, I've loved staying up late to dive into activities that I loved: coding, brainstorming, painting, or simply following my curiosity. In college, my roommates often found me up late, building projects or just enjoying my solitude. They never really understood why I did it. Fair enough, even I didn't fully understand it either until I put it into words.

During those late hours, I feel incredibly productive and focused. It's not that I can't concentrate at other times, but there's something about the quiet of the night that helps me let go of everything else. When I'm in that zone, I don't expect anything from my work, which brings out my best.

I know there are health concerns with staying up late, but what works for me is going to bed early and waking up early (around 9 PM to 3 AM). Nah! I don't follow it that frequently and end up staying up late and wake up late. Don't take my advice just do what feels right to you and yea just enjoy the process.
