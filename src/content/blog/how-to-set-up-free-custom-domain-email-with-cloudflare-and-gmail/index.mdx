You can get a free email with your domain and it slaps, (Thanks, Cloudflare + Gmail).

I thought if you wanted an email like `name@jhadoopocha.com`, you had to pay Google or Zoho or some sketchy hosting guy named Rajesh.

While setting up email subscription for this blog (bottom right), found out Cloudflare lets you do it for free. And you can even make those emails land in your regular Gmail inbox. One inbox to rule them all. ðŸ”¥

I was literally paying for two Google Workspace accounts before this. TWO.

We'll be using Cloudflare's free email routing feature to set up a custom email address for your domain, and then forwarding those emails to your Gmail account. This way, you can send and receive emails from your custom domain without paying a dime.

## Why you need a custom email

Your have got a cool domain for your product/website (if you don't, you are ngmi), but your support email is something like `coolstartuphelp@gmail.com`, youâ€™re leaking credibility faster than a bucket with no bottom.

Using a custom email like help@coolstartup.com is worth the 5-minute setup:

- **Professionalism**: It looks more legit and trustworthy.
- **Branding**: It reinforces your brand every time you send an email.
- **Control**: You own the domain, so you control the email addresses.
- **Deliverability**: Custom domain emails (if set up right) often have better deliverability and are less likely to go to spam.
- **Scalability**: You can create `team@`, `support@`, etc without juggling multiple Google accounts.

Even if you are a solo developer, having a custom email makes you look more serious about your work. Itâ€™s like wearing a suit to a meeting instead of pajamas.

## Before You Start

To use Email Routing, your domain's DNS must be managed by Cloudflare else it won't work.

let's begin with the setup, assuming you already have your domain set up with Cloudflare. If not, go do that first by [adding your domain to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/).

## Step 1: Set Up Email Routing in Cloudflare

1. Go to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), you'll see your domains listed there.
2. Select your domain from the list
3. In the left sidebar, head to **Email** > **Routing**.

4. Click on **Get Started** if you are starting fresh if not then head to routing rules and scroll down click on "Create Address".

5. Add your custom email address in the **Email Address** field, select action as **Send to Email** and destination as your primary Gmail address like so:
   ![create email address](./cloudflare-email-routing.png)

6. Cloudflare will prompt you to add some DNS records to verify your domain and set up email routing. Click on **Add records and enable** to proceed.

From cloudfare end we are set. Let's setup our Gmail to send/receive emails from this custom address.

## Step 2: Configure Gmail to Send/Receive Emails

1. Open Gmail and go to **Settings** (gear icon in the top right corner) and click on **See all settings**.

2. Go to the **Accounts and Import** tab > **send mail as** > **Add another email address**.

3. In the pop-up, enter your custom email address and the name you want to associate it with.

4. Hit next and now we need to add the SMPT server. Gmail will automatically pick up the one from Cloudflare but it doesn't support so we need to stick with the Google's SMTP.

5. Use the following settings:
   - SMTP Server: `smtp.gmail.com`
   - Port: `587`
   - Username: Your Gmail address (primary gmail address not custom one)
   - Password: Your App Password if you have 2FA enabled (not Gmail Password).
   - Check the box for **Secured connection using TLS**.

<Callout variant="note">
  The password in the above step is Google App Password (not your GMail
  password). Go ahead and create one
  [here](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords). Make sure you have two
  factor auth enabled on your Google account to use App Passwords.

Here is a detailed guide for [creating Google App Passwords](https://docs.saleshandy.com/en/articles/10182595-how-to-set-up-an-app-password-in-google).

If you follow the above steps correctly, Gmail will send a verification email to your custom email address. Since we have set up email routing in Cloudflare, this email will be forwarded to your primary Gmail inbox.

![gmail verification email](./confirmation-email.png)

in my case they'll send to hello@souvikinator.com but since we configured it to forward to my primary Gmail, it'll show up in my personal email souvikat001@gmail.com. But if you see carefully it the receiving email is the custom one.

## How to use custom email in Gmail

Now that you have set up your custom email address, you can use it to send and receive emails directly from your Gmail account.

When composing a new email, you can select your custom email address from the "From" dropdown menu. This way, your recipients will see your custom email address instead of your primary Gmail address.

here is a test email to show how it looks like when you send an email from your custom email address:
