You can get a free email with your domain, and itâ€™s amazing (Thanks, Cloudflare + Gmail).

I used to think that having an email like `name@jhadoopocha.com` required paying Google, Zoho, or some sketchy hosting provider. But while setting up email subscriptions for this blog (bottom right, go ahead and subscribe ðŸ˜ƒ), I discovered that Cloudflare lets you do it for free. Even better, you can make those emails land directly in your regular Gmail inbox. One inbox to rule them all. ðŸ”¥

I was literally paying for two Google Workspace accounts before this. TWO. Now, Iâ€™m saving money and still getting the same functionality.

This guide will show you how to use Cloudflareâ€™s free email routing feature to set up a custom email address for your domain and forward those emails to your Gmail account. Youâ€™ll be able to send and receive emails from your custom domain without spending a dime.

## Why You Need a Custom Email

Having a cool domain for your product or website is great, but if your support email is something like `coolstartuphelp@gmail.com`, youâ€™re leaking credibility faster than a bucket with no bottom.

Using a custom email like `help@coolstartup.com` is worth the 5-minute setup:

- **Professionalism**: It looks more legit and trustworthy.
- **Branding**: It reinforces your brand every time you send an email.
- **Control**: You own the domain, so you control the email addresses.
- **Deliverability**: Custom domain emails (if set up right) often have better deliverability and are less likely to go to spam.
- **Scalability**: You can create `team@`, `support@`, etc., without juggling multiple Google accounts.

Even if youâ€™re a solo developer, having a custom email makes you look more serious about your work. Itâ€™s like wearing a suit to a meeting instead of pajamas.

## Before You Start

To use Email Routing, your domainâ€™s DNS must be managed by Cloudflare. If it isnâ€™t, this wonâ€™t work.

Letâ€™s begin the setup, assuming you already have your domain set up with Cloudflare. If not, start by [adding your domain to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/add-site/).

## Set Up Email Routing in Cloudflare

1. Go to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), where youâ€™ll see your domains listed.
2. Select your domain from the list.
3. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Email** > **Routing**.

4. Click **Get Started** if youâ€™re starting fresh. Otherwise, go to routing rules and click **Create Address**.

5. Add your custom email address in the **Email Address** field, select **Send to Email** as the action, and set the destination to your primary Gmail address:

6. Cloudflare will prompt you to add some DNS records to verify your domain and set up email routing. Click **Add records and enable** to proceed.

Thatâ€™s it for the Cloudflare setup. Now, letâ€™s configure Gmail to send and receive emails from this custom address.

## Configure Gmail to Send/Receive Emails

1. Open Gmail and go to **Settings** (gear icon in the top right corner), then click **See all settings**.
2. Navigate to the **Accounts and Import** tab > **Send mail as** > **Add another email address**.

3. In the pop-up, enter your custom email address and the name you want to associate with it.

4. Click **Next**. Use the following SMTP settings:
   - SMTP Server: `smtp.gmail.com`
   - Port: `587`
   - Username: Your primary Gmail address.
   - Password: Your App Password (if 2FA is enabled).
   - Check **Secured connection using TLS**.

<Callout variant="note">
  The password is your Google App Password (not your Gmail password). Create one [here](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords). Ensure 2FA is enabled on your Google account.

If you follow the above steps correctly, Gmail will send a verification email to your custom email address. Since weâ€™ve set up email routing in Cloudflare, this email will be forwarded to your primary Gmail inbox.

In my case, theyâ€™ll send it to `hello@souvikinator.com`, but since we configured it to forward to my primary Gmail, itâ€™ll show up in my personal email `souvikat001@gmail.com`. If you look closely, the receiving email is the custom one.

## How to Use Custom Email in Gmail

Now that youâ€™ve set up your custom email address, you can use it to send and receive emails directly from your Gmail account.

When composing a new email, you can select your custom email address from the **From** dropdown menu. This way, your recipients will see your custom email address instead of your primary Gmail address.
